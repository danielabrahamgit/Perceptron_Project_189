    "Perceptrons are the building blocks of Neural Networks, and while this may sound complicated, their function is well defined by simple Linear Algebra concepts that you are already very familiar with.  As with Neural Networks in general, Perceptrons can be understood through an analogy to biology.  Our brain is composed of Neurons; each Neuron has many dendrites branching out to recieve signals, a cell body that process these inputs, and a single Axon which sends out information to other Neurons.  While a single Neuron cannot accomplish much on its own, combining a whole network of them allows for the incedible functionality that we get from our brain.  An Artificial Neural Network functions in much the same way, with powerful emergent properties coming out of the combination of simple building blocks.  In this analogy, the Perceptron acts as a single Neuron.  And while in later weeks we will examine how Neural Networks are formed by linking these together, this week we will focus on the structure of a single Perceptron and the problems it is able to solve."

    "A Perceptron is known as a Binary Linear Classifier.  This means it is a good model to use so long as we have a set of linearly separable data that we want to put into two different categories.  While later in this homework you will look into the different python toolkits that allow us to work with Perceptrons, we will start off by building one by hand.  Perceptrons are relatively simple to construct, and doing so should give you a deeper understanding of how and when to use the prebuilt libraries.\n",

    "Above is a picture of a Perceptron. From here the components should be pretty easy to see.  We have an array of inputs, their corresponding weights, and an activation function (in the above model this activation function is more specifically a step function).  Make sure this picture makes sense to you, because now we will be building out a Perceptron class.  <br>Specifically, we want our Perceptron class to be able to do the following:\n",
    "* Take a weighted sum\n",
    "* Compute an activation function\n",

    "You may have noticed that your perceptron did not do a great job making predictions and separating the data.  In this section we will explore why this is.  If you look closely at the perceptron diagram at the start of this assignment, you should notice one key aspect that we have not included.  It is the constant term that is added into the weighted sum, this is what we call the bias.  To analyze why this is needed, lets take a look at the 2D example of a Perceptron.  If we have inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ and weights $w_1$ and $w_2$, taking the weighted sum combined with our activation function gives us a boundary at:\n",

    "$$x_1*w_1 + x_2*w_2 = 0$$\n",
    "$$x_2 = -\\frac{w_1}{w_2}*x_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this defines a line at the origin with a slope of $-\\frac{w_1}{w_2}$.  If you look back at the results from John's data, you should see that the line our perceptron generated is indeed going through the origin.  Clearly no such line will be good at separating our data, so we need to add a bias if we want a line with a different y-intercept.  When we append a constant to our input and give it a corresponding weight, our 2D example becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1*w_0 + x_1*w_1 + x_2*w_2 = 0$$\n",
    "$$x_2 = -\\frac{w_1}{w_2}*x_1 - \\frac{w_0}{w_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this defines a new line with the same slope as before, but a y-intercept now at $- \\frac{w_0}{w_2}$.  This extends to higher dimensions as well; a constant term should always be augmented to the input data. **Lets implement this step by filling in the addBias function below.**"

    "Unless you are very lucky, you probably noticied that the perceptron misclassified some of the candy.  Even after taking data from your friends' games, the Perceptron was not able to pick up on the exact linear pattern that Sally was following.  So when she laid out the candy for your, some of the pieces right near the boundary were labeled incorrectly.  There are a couple valid solutions, an easy one is to watch your friends play more games so you can gather more data.  Another less obvious solution that touches on topics learned later in this course would be to pick a boundary line exactly inbetween the two classes of data (if you scroll up you should see that our Perceptron's line isn't totally centered)"

    "Hopefully this first part of the notebook has given you a better understanding of what a Perceptron is and how they are used.  After building your own Perceptron class you should not only understand why it is called a Binary Linear Classifier, but also see the importance of the bias term.  Finally, the last section should have made clear some of the shortcomings of Perceptron, especially when we are lacking data.  In the next part of this notebook we will be exploring how Perceptron can (and can't) be used on some more advanced problems.  You will also be introcuded to the prebuilt python libraries that you can use to implement Perceptron. "

    "In this part of the notebook, we will cover an extension of the Binary Perceptron that was done above. Recall that for the Binary Perceptron, one requirement of the data was that there could only be two output classes. This meant that if we wanted to classify some input as more than just two outputs, we would have to look elsewhere for a solution. However, with some slight modifications to the Binary Perceptron, we are able to classify inputs with any amount of labels. "

    "To motivate studying the Multiclass Perceptron, let us revisit the candy example. Recall that Sally had two types of candy (spicy or sweet) and our job was to determine what type a candy was. Suppose that Sally now has three types of candy: spicy, sweet, and salty. Now instead of laying out the candies in some linear pattern, Sally decides to make it easier for us by putting candies of similar type near each other into clusters. Even though our goal still remains the same, we cannot use the binary perceptrons since there's more than two classes. We represent the candy type in code as labels 0, 1, or 2."

The class that we predict the input as is then the class corresponding to the largest dot product. Mathematically, this is taking the argmax of the dot product of our input and every weight vector."

    "Now we will define some usefull functions that will help us process the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first function is **numpy_fillna**. This function will simply take in a 2d numpy array where the row vectors are not the same length, and return a 2d numpy array where all the row vectors have the same length. To do this, we simply zero-pad the short row vectors/data vectors to match the length of the longer ones. Worry not, this does not change the relevent audio data at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "The second function is **get_train_test**. This function performs a few important steps, let us break it down:\n",
    "1. It will first use the argument N (total number of data points, 50% dog, 50% cat), and r_train (the ratio of training data to testing data) to calculate the number of training samples that we need. The big idea here is to take our data set and partition it into a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset (can be something like 80% of all the data) will be used to actually train the perceptron. The testing dataset (whatever is leftover, 20%) will be used to acually test our perceptron on 'fresh' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When accumulating the data from the .wav files, this function will trim the audio files nicely. It does this because alot of the times, the audio files have a very unessesary sequence of zeros before the initial useful audio data arrives. It will first find the time point where the audio hits 50% of the maximum value. Then, we instruct the function to call the start of the audio vector 'pre' units before this 50% time point. We can tune pre to untill the audio data appears to be alligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It will also normalize all the audio vectors by removing their mean and making their variance = 1. The reason for this is to treat very loud audio the same as very soft audio. We have no preference over loud or soft audio when classifying. We subtract the mean in order to remove the offset in audio, which we also do not care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, the function will put all these normalized and trimmed audio vectors into a large 2d array. Now there is no gurantee that all the row vectors (data/audio vectors) in this 2d array will have the same length. This is where we use **numpy_fillna** to assert this property. Once this is done, we shuffle up the row vectors in order to make the data randomized with respect to the labels. A minor detail: The function will also return the samplerate of the audio data."

The discrete fourier transform, or DFT! Why would we even think of using this? Well, first let us ask, what is the best machine for classifying audio? It is us, humans that are the best at this task. This is partially due to the fact that the human ear canal performs a pseudo fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the DFT of the audio data will provide us with information on how dominant certain frequencies are. This is important for speech recognition because that human audio only exists in a narrow frequency band (< 4kHz). So, if we take the DFT of our data and omit all frequencies above 6000 Hz (to be safe), we will essentially only be capturing the relevant informatin from the audio sample. This is a method of taking an extremeley long audio sample and reducing it down to its more fundemental components, which is what we wanted to do! Recall that our problem was that the vectors were too long/had too many parameters. By taking the DFT and omitting all frequencies above 6000Hz, we will be reducing the number of parameters significantly.\n",

This will result in the same thing, however the FFT computes the DFT in $O(nlogn)$ time rather than $O(n^2)$ time with the 16B method.

We also learned that something as simple as a single layer perceptron can be surprisingly powerful given the right data and the right choice of features. "
